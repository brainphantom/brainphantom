Welcome to my profile👋
I am a French developer specializing in Brainfuck. 
Some people might think this language is useless, 
but Brainfuck was the first programming language I learned. 
Looking back, 
it might seem like a somewhat silly start to my journey… 🫠 
something that might make some people give up quickly.
Fortunately, 
I know other languages: Python, Batch.
Of course, 
I have basic knowledge in many programming languages: 
JavaScript, C, C++, C#, PHP, CSS, TypeScript, HTML, Go, Rust, Lua, Ruby… (There are more).
I am very active on Discord and I enjoy helping people.
